# FastAPI JWT Authentication (Learning Project)

This repository contains a simple JWT authentication system built while learning about:
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Access & refresh tokens (JWT)
- Protected routes
- Logout and token blacklisting
- Basic rate limiting

üß† This was created as part of my personal learning journey using AI assistance to understand how authentication works in modern web APIs.
